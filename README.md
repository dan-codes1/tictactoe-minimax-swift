# TicTacToe-MiniMax-Swift

This repository creates a simple Tic Tac Toe game in Swift. It uses the MiniMax AI Adveserial Search Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to determine moves for AI.

### ⚠️ DISCLAIMERS:
1. Though the MiniMax + Alpha-Beta pruning algorithm used in this project is feasible, it may not be the optimal algorithm for the Tic Tac Toe game.
2. This is **not** a production product. It is a repository I created while learning about AI to help practicalize my learning.

The MiniMax algorithm is in the GameSearchEngine.swift file.
