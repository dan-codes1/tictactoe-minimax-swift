This repository creates a simple Tic Tac Toe game in Swift. It uses the MiniMax AI Adveserial Search Algorithm to determine moves for AI.

### ⚠️ DISCLAIMERS:
1. Though the MiniMax AI akgorithm used in this project is feasible and unbeatable, it may not be the optimal algorithm for the Tic Tac Toe game.
2. This is not a production product. It is a repository I created while learning about AI to help practicalize my learning.
